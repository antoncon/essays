    <h1>Just write it</h1>

    

    <p>Whenever I want to learn anything, I do so by writing it down in paragraph form. Writing forces you to structure new information in a way that is understandable to you and to others. An idea might initially make sense to you but its true test is if it understood by others, but more specifically by an &ldquo;imagined other&rdquo;. Will this idea, if I share it with those I wish to share it with, come to life? Will it mean anything to them? Well, that depends on how that idea is structured in your mind.</p>
<p>So, here I write down ideas that I wish to structure so that they may come to life. To my own and hopefully, to others as well.</p>
